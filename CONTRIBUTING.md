# Contributing to pyCAX

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Follow Installation instructions in the [README](https://github.com/iobis/pyobis/blob/master/README.rst)
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Issue that pull request!
    + Make sure your pull requests are in-detail and includes:
        - a good title and a summary describing the changes you made with your set of edits
        - notes for reviewers, if in case you wish to add some additional points for the reviewers to make a note of
        - whenever possible, break pull requests into smaller ones.
        - make sure the pull request should do only one thing - single objective for a single PR.
